This guide assumes that you already have a Github account and edit rights to the wiki. If you do not, follow steps 1 and 2 [here.](wiki/adding-wiki-pages-regular-people.markdown)
      
1. Navigate to the [repository for the wiki](https://github.com/Team-2502/Team-2502.github.io).
    <br  />
    
    When you get to the repository's home page, it should look something like this:
    
    ![Image of front page of wiki repository]({{ "assets/wiki-repo-homepage.png" | absolute_url}})

1. Navigate to the page you want to edit and click the pencil button to edit the page

    ![An image of the edit button on GitHub]({{ "assets/edit-button-github.png" | absolute_url}})

1. Edit the the wiki page as you see fit. The wiki uses Markdown formatting, which will let you add subheadings, bullet points, and so forth. To learn about how to use Markdown, click [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

1. Commit your new file to the `master` branch.

1. After a short period, your page will be visible on the wiki!
