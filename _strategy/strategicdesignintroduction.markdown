Oh, Herro Dere! This is probably the most important part in designing a robot for FIRST robotics. Considering since this was previously outlawed by the really dum people on this team, some people don't know about it, but now a days nobody even knows that was outlawed. Sad bois. People who think they know what they are doing but actually can't build for crap normally do not understand design strategy. So that's why this is important.
