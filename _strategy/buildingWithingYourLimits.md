This is essentially the foundation of a lot of decisions in strategic design. Despite a lot of this being simple, these pages should not be undermined. Unless you like mining underneath the ground.
# Robot units

# Prior Experience

# Similarities to and Elite Team

# The Bandwagon and the Cool Factor
Essentially, this means doing really dum stuff just because everybody else does it or doing something purely becasue it's "cool."

Now there's a concrete difference between the bandwagon and differentiating youself. Just because a lot of people do something, doesn't necessarily mean that you are jumping on the bandwagon. For example, in 2017 everyone was able to climb... and for a good reason. If you didn't climb, you were never going to get picked becasue due to how poor of a game it is, one missed climb completely undermines the performance of every other robot in most important matches, such as elimination finals. Yes no yes no???
