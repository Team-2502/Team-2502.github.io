## Welcome potentially future programmers!
#### Before you set your eyes on being a programmer, it is important to understand:
> Many experts say that programming is the new skill that is required for the 21st century, much like reading was a skill required throughout the 20th. However, much like reading, learning to program takes a lot of effort and dedication.

It is impossible to learn algebra before arithmetic. Similarly, it is impossible to take giant shortcuts to learn programming. 

## So, how does one learn to program a robot?
We use the language **Java** (note _JavaScript_ is not related to Java!). Java is a very popular **programming language** and is used for Android applications, Minecraft, and much more. _If you are interested in either of these topics, they can help jump start your adventures with Java._ DON'T HESITATE.

## But how do I _actually_ start?

The following can help:
- If you are inspired to become a prestigous Java programmer, read the book [Java for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Java-All-One-Dummies-Doug/dp/1118408039). This is rather long, but it teaches the basics of the language _very_ well. Books might be old, but they are heavily edited and usually quality material.
- Take AP Computer Science A (AP Java). This course is available at EPHS. 
- Take [this edX Course](https://www.edx.org/course/ap-computer-science-java-programming-purduex-cs180-2x-0) (video oriented). edX is made up of _MOOCs_ (Massive Open Online Courses) which are often made by top college professorsâ€”and they are free!
- If you need any help from us, talk to us in our [Slack](https://team2502.slack.com/signup) (basically a better Discord).
