# Compiling and Running a Java Class
Intellij automatically compiles your classes for you before running them, so generally you will not need to compile any classes manually

You can also run the debugger by hitting the green bug to the right of the arrow at the top right of the window

## Options
1. Green arrow in top right corner
2. Green arrow near main method
3. Green arrow at class decleration
4. Green arrow in run panel (only available after running the class at least once
5. Control-R shortcut on Macs
