# Why? 
Pure Pursuit has caused me a lot of reading papers, taking notes, and a few headaches. It is extremely fun though, and it teaches you a lot of maths :). I will try to explain it here, and have also listed several resources I have used to learn this.

- [Projective Geometry](http://robotics.stanford.edu/~birch/projective/node1.html)
  - I reccomend going through node4 (inclusive). Most of the rest is not needed
- [Mobile Robot Kinematics]({{ site.url }}/assets/mobile_robot_kinematics.pdf)
  - Note: the matrices at the end can be intimidating. To know how these work (assuming you know Linear Algebra) learn [Projective Geometry](http://robotics.stanford.edu/~birch/projective/node1.html)
