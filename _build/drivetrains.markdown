You should build a tank drive unless there is an extenuating situation, such as a game that effectively makes defense impossible (e.g Recycle Rush). Even then, be careful of weight, and strongly consider doing tank drive for its simplicity.


# Types of Tank Drive

There are a few types of tank drive that you should be aware of

## 6 wheel dropped center

This is our preferred drivetrain at Talon Robotics. We normally drop the center by 1/8 of an inch. This makes it easier for the robot to turn. However, this can lead to the robot becomming wobbly when it is rather tall, like it was in 2018.

A good example is the drivetrain of Midnight (2016), Herschel/Voyager (2017), or Daedalus (2018).

## 6 wheel flat

Sometimes, having the dropped center on a very tall robot can lead to tippiness and instablity. As a result, it may be a better idea to construct a 6 wheel flat drivetrain. However, to ensure that the ability to turn is not impeded, you *must* put omni wheels in the corners. Otherwise, turning will *always* be inconsistent as far as how it affects absolute robot position goes. If you didn't understand that last sentence, it means that your programmers will be sad if you forget to put your omnis in the corners.

A good example is Cheezy Poof's 2018 robot: Lockdown.

# Considerations to make when designing a drivetrain

## Gear ratio(s)

You will need to select gear ratio(s) on your drivetrain before you order your gear boxes. If you're using a 2-speed transmission, pick a low gear ratio suitable for pushing/defense and a high gear for going fast. The specific gear ratios vary based on the challenge.

## Number of links of chain

You should try to space your drivetrain holes such that an integer number of chain links is required between each sprocket. More details can be found [here](/build/gearsandsprockets.html)
