# Motors
These are the spinning things that move almost everything on the robot. There is a spread sheet with all the info needed to calculate gear ratios. All gearboxes and motors should be run through [this](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/2/b/2bf9206b962f74ed5556a0ae936ef0bf365ac975.xlsx) to confirm if it works.

These are fast motors that have low stall torque. This means they can not do heavy lifting. Versa Planetary gearboxes are added to slow them down and give them more torque. We generally use this for active intakes and elevators. If there are stall issues multiple motors can be added to a gearbox.
