Here is where we talk about basic parts, what they look like, and applications for them. Read through this, and then use it as a reference, because these parts will be referred to a lot in the wiki.

## Tools
Yes, even something as simple as tools need to be discussed. Crescent wrench, screwdriver, are all easy ones. But when you get into things like step and spade bits, vice (if you are the CMS tech ed teacher), deburer, side cutters, then it's where people become less familiar with them.
* Wrenches
    * **NEVER USE CRESCENT WRENCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
* Socket

* Power Tools
    * Drill Bit
    * Reciprocating Saw
    * Jigsaw
    * Circular Saw
    * Angle Grinder
    * Drill Press
    * Bandsaw
    * Miter Saw

## Bearings
If we were to stick a hex shaft in a hole and spin it, it would become round. Bearings decrease the friction of rotating objects and prevent our hex shaft from becoming a round shaft.
* Normal
* Radial

## Shafts
Everything you would want to know about the shafts we mainly use in the room. Everything that you could want to use with a shaft is lovated here, such as collars and lead screws.
* Hex Shaft
    * Has a hexagonal cross section
* Round Shaft
    * Has a circular cross section
* Lead Screws
    * Is threaded
* Shaft Collars
    * Prevents shafts from sliding out of bearings

## Wheels
* Traction Wheels
* Omni Wheels
    * Has rollers parallel to the wheel (look at an image).
* Mecanum Wheel
    * Has rollers at a 45 degree angle to the wheel
* Colson Wheels
* Banebot Wheels

## Springs and Surgical Tubing
When you stretch it, it wants to go back to being unstretched, creating a pulling force.

## Poly cord and Pulleys

## Gussets/Brackets

## Poly Carbonate
This is basically plastic. 

## Rivets
These are "permanent" fasteners that can only be removed with a drill or angle grinder.
