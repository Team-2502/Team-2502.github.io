Here is where we talk about basic parts, what they look like, and applications for them. Read through this, and then use it as a reference, because these parts will be referred to a lot in the wiki.

## Tools
Yes, even something as simple as tools need to be discussed. Crescent wrenches, screwdrivers, these are the easy ones. However, when you get into things like step and spade bits, deburring methods, side cutters, people become less familiar.
* Wrenches
    * **NEVER USE CRESCENT WRENCHES!!!**
        * They usually do not fit where you want them to and will round your nut.
* Socket
   * Like a wrench. Usually comes attached to a ratchet device or drill.

* Power Tools
    * Hole drilling tools: These tools go with a drillbit.
      * (Handheld) Drill: Drill holes quickly, at angles, or in tight spots
      * Drill Press: Drill straight up-and down holes precisely
    * Reciprocating Saw 
      * Also known as a "recip" or "sawzall"
      * A saw that goes back and forth. Sort of like a jigsaw on steroids.
    * Jigsaw
      * A tiny, bandsaw-sized blade that goes back and forth. Can make wavy cuts.
    * Circular Saw
      * A handheld saw with a circular blade. Makes straight cuts.
    * Angle Grinder
      * A very versatile tool. You can change the discs in it to either sand/polish/grind at or cut things
    * Bandsaw
      * A small saw blade that can be used to make wavy cuts. 
    * Miter Saw
      * Like a circular saw but is not handheld. Only goes up and down.

## Bearings
If we were to stick a hex shaft in a hole and spin it, it would become round. Bearings decrease the friction of rotating objects and prevent our hex shaft from becoming a round shaft.
* Normal
* Radial

## Shafts
Everything you would want to know about the shafts we mainly use in the room. Everything that you could want to use with a shaft is lovated here, such as collars and lead screws.
* Hex Shaft
    * Has a hexagonal cross section
* Round Shaft
    * Has a circular cross section
* Lead Screws
    * Is threaded
* Shaft Collars
    * Prevents shafts from sliding out of bearings

## Wheels
* Traction Wheels
* Omni Wheels
    * Has rollers parallel to the wheel (look at an image).
* Mecanum Wheel
    * Has rollers at a 45 degree angle to the wheel
* Colson Wheels
* Banebot Wheels

## Springs and Surgical Tubing
When you stretch it, it wants to go back to being unstretched, creating a pulling force.

## Poly cord and Pulleys
Used to transfer force. Usually, it is rotational, but using a winch, linear force can also be transferred. 

## Gussets/Brackets
Used to attach two pieces of metal together. Usually accompanied by rivets or bolts

## Polycarbonate
This is basically plastic. 

## Rivets
These are "permanent" fasteners that can only be removed with a drill or angle grinder.
