Here is where we talk about basic parts, what they look like, and applications for them. Read through this, and then use it as a reference, because these parts will be referred to a lot in the wiki.

## Tools
Yes, even something as simple as tools need to be discussed. Crescent wrenches, screwdrivers, these are the easy ones. However, when you get into things like step and spade bits, deburring methods, side cutters, people become less familiar.
* Wrenches
    * NEVER USE CRESCENT WRENCHES!!!
    * They usually do not fit where you want them to and will round your nut.
    * The common sizes can be found in their seperate containers. 
    * 7/16 is commonly used for 1/4-20 nuts and 3/8 is commonly used for 10-32 nuts
* Socket
    * Like a wrench. Usually comes attached to a ratchet device or drill.
* Allen Wrenches 
    * It is the hex-shaped thing in the screwdriver drawer
    * The most common used one is the yellow handled ones. 
        * These are referred to as yellow handles and "beefy".
        * Beefy is the yellow handle with gray duct tape.
        * Yellow handles are used for mostly for 80-20 bolts and 10-32 CapHead socket bolts. 
        * Beefy is used for 1/4-20 CapHead socket bolts.
    * The next most common one is 1/8 which is used for all other 10-32 and 10-24.
    * We also have a special Allen Wrench with gray duct tape on it. 
        * This allen wrench is used for shaft collars mainly.

* Power Tools
    * Hole drilling tools: These tools go with a drill bit.
      * (Handheld) Drill: Drill holes quickly, at angles, in tight spots, or on big parts.
      * Drill Press: Drill straight up and down holes precisely
    * Reciprocating Saw 
      * Also known as a "recip" or "sawzall"
      * A saw that goes back and forth. Sort of like a jigsaw on steroids.
      * This is used for vertical or horizontal cuts that are not flat on a table.
    * Jigsaw
      * A tiny, bandsaw-sized blade that goes back and forth. Can make wavy cuts.
      * This is used for curved cuts or big pieces that can be laid flat. 
    * Circular Saw
      * A handheld saw with a circular blade. Makes straight cuts.
      * We do have one we just never use it because we do not need to. 
    * Angle Grinder
      * A very versatile tool. You can change the discs in it to either sand/polish/grind at or cut things
      * Mainly used for cutting steel or grinding Aluminum
      * When selecting a disk make sure to use the appropriate disk for the appropriate material.
    * Bandsaw
      * A small saw blade that can be used to make wavy cuts.
      * There are two of these in the room
      * They are the easiest to make straight cuts and should be used whenever the material you are cutting fits. 
    * Miter Saw
      * Like a circular saw but is not handheld. Only goes up and down.
      * We only have wood blades for it but it makes straight cuts.
      * Make sure a piece is clamped using the clamp whenever you are cutting.
    * Oscillating Tool
      * A tool used for cutting metal or plastic.
      * Make sure piece is really secure so it does not oscillate with the tool.
      * This is used mainly for parts on the robot that move a lot or are hard to reach with other tools. 
    * Dremel
      * Pretty much all the same uses as the oscillating tool.
      * Cutting wheels are disposable and will break after many uses. 
    * Slotting Tool
      * This tool is used for enlarging holes
      * The bit of this tool breaks if the tool is not perfectly level.
      * This tool will also jump a lot so be careful when using. 
* Other Tools
    * Soldering Iron
        * Used for soldering wires together.
        * Make sure wires are held together before applying the solder.
        * Heat the wires before applying the solder. 
    * Pneumatic tools
        * We mainly use the air blower.
        * Don't point the air blower at people.
        * Blow out electronics after working on the robot so nothing is shorted. 

## Bearings
If we were to stick a hex shaft in a hole and spin it, it would become round. Bearings decrease the friction of rotating objects and prevent our hex shaft from becoming a round shaft. Bearings are also used for round shafts to reduce friction between spinning things. Hex shafts are used more commonly because of other advantages of the shaft to be discussed later on. 
* Normal
* Radial

## Shafts
Everything you would want to know about the shafts we mainly use in the room. Everything that you could want to use with a shaft is located here, such as collars and lead screws.
* Hex Shaft
    * Has a hexagonal cross section.
    * The hexagonal shaft does not slip in holes or bearings so it is preferred for anything that is driven. 
    * 775 vex planetary gearboxes use this.
    * In the past this has been used for drivetrain, actives, and anything else spun by a motor.
* Round Shaft
    * Has a circular cross section.
    * A key is needed to make sure things spin with the shaft.
    * CIM motors have this for default so keys are needed to hold pinion gears on. 
* Lead Screws
    * Is a threaded rod.
    * Mainly used for horizontal motion but can be used for vertical motion
        * Only use for vertical motion if absolutely necessary because a winch or another system does not physically work in any way. 
    * Very slow but does give precise positions.
* Shaft Collars
    * Prevents shafts from sliding out of bearings.
    * Used to prevent anything from moving on a shaft.
    * They are only not needed when the shaft is full with spacers and wheels or other objects. The collar can then be replaced but a washer and bolt on the end of the shaft.

## Wheels
* Traction Wheels
* Omni Wheels
    * Has rollers parallel to the wheel (look at an image).
    * This allows the wheel to slide sideways.
    * This has almost no friction and will slide anywhere. 
* Mecanum Wheel
    * Has rollers at a 45 degree angle to the wheel.
    * This wheel is designed so the wheel can make the robot move sideways to it's motion. 
    * This wheel is really useful on active intakes.
* Colson Wheels
    * These are the high traction grey wheels.
    * Used mostly on actives but can be used on the drive train depending on the game.
    * There is a limit to how big they are, so check the diameter you want before picking this wheel.
* Banebot Wheels
    * Similar to Colson wheels, but slightly less durable. 
    * These come in more sizes then Colsons. 
    * In bigger sizes hubs need to be ordered separately.
    * Used for actives and internal game element movement almost exclusively.
* Tread Wheels
    * These are pretty much only used on the drive train.
    * They are a hub with tread wrapped around it.
    * Tread and hub can be ordered together or separate. 
    * The type of tread determines the traction.
    * Tread can be attached with rivets or tread clips.
    

## Springs and Surgical Tubing
When you stretch it, it wants to go back to being unstretched, creating a pulling force. Surgical tubing can be used to assist another form of a pulling force, such has an active or linear slide. Another type of spring that can assist motors are constant force springs, like the spring in a measuring tape. Constant force springs apply a constant force that can be rotational or vertical. This force makes less work for the motor so less torque can bee needed by the motor. 

## Poly cord and Pulleys
Used to transfer force. Usually, it is rotational, but using a winch, linear force can also be transferred. Poly cord can be used as belts to move game elements through the robot as well. 

## Gussets/Brackets
Used to attach two pieces of metal together. Usually accompanied by rivets or bolts. These are usually tack welded if they are holding the frame together or are a more structural component. 

## Polycarbonate
This is basically plastic. It is a light weight material that can be used for low stress jobs or walls to the robot. Mostly used to protect electronics but can be used as a hopper for balls or other game elements. Andymark sells polycarbonate with holes in it that is used on the electronics plate. 

## Rivets
These are "permanent" fasteners that can only be removed with a drill or angle grinder. Rivets will also loosen over time under high stress conditions. This problem is increased when the rivet is done improperly or in a bigger hole then the rivet is made for. To properly rivet a piece make sure you are applying a force perpendicular to the piece you are attaching. Long, full pumps of the handle also allow for a nice finish to the rivet.
