There are multiple kinds of climbers that you can make. Some are better than others and depend a lot on the other items going on the robot. The climber also relies heavily on the way the game makes you climb. A winch is the suggested way of lifting the robot with all of these ideas.  

# Rotating Robot
* Used if you have a smaller robot that has an even distribution of weight. 
* Depends heavily on weight distribution and where the robot sits.
* This will also depend a lot on how much you have to climb and how much space you have. 

# Linear
* This works really well if you already have to make an elevator. 
* This will be a relatively heavy and slow climb.
* The use of this will be most dependant on how much distance you need to climb and space in the robot. 

# Delivering a Hook
* The hook can be delivered in many ways different ways. 
* You want to design the hook to not come off after being put on the bar.
* This is really light and will generally look really sketchy.
* This can be really quick especially if it spring loaded.
* It can be difficult to control the hook depending on how it is delivered.
