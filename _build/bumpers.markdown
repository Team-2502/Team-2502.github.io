Here is what to do and what not to do while building bumpers. 

**Do Not Make Reversible Bumpers:** They seem easier to switch but they are harder to make and down in the mounting section there is a way to mount the bumpers that is easy to change while still being strong. Therefore, there is no point to reversible bumpers. 

## Materials needed 
Materials are minimums for 3 sets of bumpers. and there are left overs so check quantities of what's in stock before ordering more. Most items can be found at Menard's. 
- [ ] 72" 2x2 1/8” angle
- [ ] 72 1/4-20 3/4” bolts (any kind of flattened head will work)
- [ ] 4’ by 8’ 3/4” Plywood cut into 5" strips
- [ ] 72 1/4” T-Nuts
- [ ] 2 rolls Red, Blue, and Black duct tape (for repairs and not always needed)
- [ ] Fabric in Blue, Red, and Black (See fabric for kinds)
- [ ] 72" 1x1 1/8” angle 
- [ ] 40 3/4” wood screws 
- [ ] 72"   2” by 1/8” plate 
- [ ] 3/4” x 1/16” angle (This is an optional item that is discussed in Mounting)
- [ ] 2 1/2” pins to 3” pins (These are reused from year to year but we can always use more)
- [ ] Wood screws couple inches long (We have a lot of these and they a)
- [ ] Numbers (See below for how you want to do numbering)

## Fabric
Fabric should not rip and should last an entire season. We have found two fabrics that are relatively cheap and capable of this. 

[AndyMark Cordura fabric](https://www.andymark.com/products/blue-bumper-material-161in-x-19-5in-0-25in) is durable but it is very rough. This makes it difficult for the robot to slide by other robots. Numbers also have more problems sticking and need more care. Only available in blue and red so practice robot has to be different material or red. 

[Sports Twill](https://twillusa.com/product/polyback-sports-twill/) is a slicker material. Our team used these for practice bumpers so application to competition robot is unknown. The fabric held up well to the stresses of practice. Numbering can be easier but the more time put in to the numbers the longer they will stay. Suggested colors for ordering are red and royal blue. Practice bumpers can be in any color but Black generally looks pretty good. 



## Numbers
For 2018 and the beginning of 2019 we used [vinyl](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/54-Insignia-Cloth-Adhesive-Backed-Polyester-1995-linear-yard_p_60.html) this worked for smooth fabrics such as the sports twill. However it peels a lot on rougher fabrics like the AndyMark fabric. If it is peeling hot glue can be used for repairs.

In 2019 Connie suggested using [Stich witchery]() this was used on the AndyMark bumpers for worlds. A white cloth would have to be bought to be stuck to the fabric. This is very time consuming because of the stitching that needs to be done around the border to secure it.
