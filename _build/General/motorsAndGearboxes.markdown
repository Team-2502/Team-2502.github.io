# Motors
These are the spinning things that move almost everything on the robot. There is a spread sheet with all the info needed to calculate gear ratios. All gearboxes and motors should be run through [this spreadsheet](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/2/b/2bf9206b962f74ed5556a0ae936ef0bf365ac975.xlsx) to confirm if it works. 

## 775 Pros/AndyMark Redline
These are fast motors that have low stall torque. This means they can not do heavy lifting. Versa Planetary gearboxes are added to slow them down and give them more torque. We generally use this for active intakes and elevators. If there are stall issues multiple motors can be added to a gearbox. There are different gearboxes tha would be used for multiple inputs. They could be used in a drive train is many are used but this is generally not a well accepted practice and not as durable. These motors if used for long periods of time with lots of torque will get hot and they do not like being hot. In 2018 we had to replace many elevator motors because of this problem.   

## CIMs
These are used for the drive train and climbers. These motors are a little slower than 775s but have a high stall torque. These motors are also very durable against wear and tear. Usually only 2 are needed per gearbox in the drive train. 3 cims would give you more pushing power however it will also take more power from the battery and the trade off is considered not worth it. 1 cim motor per side does not necessarily give enough power to the robot for pushing. The quantity of motors needed for climbing is very dependent on how much is being lifted and how much torque will be put on the motor. Use the JVN design spreadsheet to confirm numbers on what will work best.

# Gearboxes


## Planetary
They have one input motor can can bought in many gear ratios. A Versa Planetary is for a 775 Pro and has many different stage reductions available. 

## Single Speed 
This works if you are unable to find the desired speeds for a two speed. This is also a simpler gearbox and it would have less failure points. The target drive train speed would be around 10 - 12 ft/sec. 

## Two Speed
The main advantage is that you would have a speed that is low enough for torque to push and a speed high enough to drive across the field quickly with control. Usually you shoot for 5 ft/sec low speed and 15 ft/sec high speed in the drive train gearbox. These can change depending on the game and what you want from the gearbox. In a lot of games the top speed is too fast so a single speed is acceptable when there is not a wide open field.
