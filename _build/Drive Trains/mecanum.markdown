A mecanum drive train uses mecanum wheels to allow robots to move sideways. Mecanum wheels have rollers at a 45 degree angle to the wheel, bought [here](https://www.vexrobotics.com/mecanum-wheels.html). There are left and right mecanum wheels and both are needed for drive trains or active intakes. The left or right determines what direction the rollers move. A mecanum drive train has four of these wheels and they are each driven independently. If they are not driven independently you might as well do tank drive. 

#### Pros:
* Mobility 
    - Able to move around the field fast
    - Moves Sideways so lining up is easier
* Fairly Easy to build
    - It is four wheels 
    - As long as you get the wheels spaced right and have space for gearboxes you are good
    - You can gear the drive train to go different speeds easily

#### Cons: 
* You will get pushed around
    - Anyone with tank drive can push you
    - You can be pushed sideways
    - You will be less likely to get drafted at Worlds 
* There is a bit of a challenge in programming
    - You have to no how to move the wheels to get to the spot you want
    - Once you get the program it is probably don
    - The programming is within our team's capabilities so it should be good
* Extra gearboxes and weight
    - Each wheel needs a gearbox
    - This is a lot of extra weight
* Wheels are expensive
    - They cost a lot
    - We do have the money but it costs more than other drive trains
* Weight has to be really well balanced
    - If your wight is not balanced it is hard to drive straight
