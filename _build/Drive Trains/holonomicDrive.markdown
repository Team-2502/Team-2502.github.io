A holonomic drive train has 4 wheels in the corners. Each wheel is at a 45 degree angle. This allows the drive train to drive in any direction and at curves. All the wheels have to be driven independently for it to work correctly. 

#### Pros:
* Agile
    * It can move in any direction 
    * It helps with lining up
    
    
#### Cons:
* No pushing force
    * The wheels do not have traction so they slide in every direction
    * You will be less likely to get picked at worlds
* Challenging to program and drive
    * Does not necessarily drive straight
    * The controls are different then tank drive driving
    * It requires learning to drive
* Extra gearboxes needed
    * Each wheel is a separate gearbox
    * There is not much space around the wheel to make a complicated gearbox
    * Limits to the speeds you can use
