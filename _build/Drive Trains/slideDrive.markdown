A Slide Drive is a drive train that is like tank drive just with omni wheels. There is also a middle wheel at a 90 degree angle to the other wheels. The drive train is also called "H-drive" because of the wheel shape. If there is no middle wheel it is still called Slide Drive, but it is kind of useless because it gets rid of some of the agility.

#### Pros:
* Agility
    * You can move all around the field
    * Lining up for scoring is easy
* Easy to Build and Program
    * Pretty much the same as tank drive
    * Tank drive is something we have done forever

#### Cons:
* No potential for pushing
    * Anyone with tank drive can push you
    * You can be pushed sideways
    * Will be held against you at worlds
* Extra wheel and Motor required  
    * Added weight from gearbox
