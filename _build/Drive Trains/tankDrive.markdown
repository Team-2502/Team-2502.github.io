A tank drive is a drive train with traction wheels that are all facing the same direction and are on both sides of the robot. 

#### Pros:
* Simple and easy to design and program
    * It has been done by every team at one point
    * It is only two gearboxes(one for each side)
    * We have done it before so we have CAD models and gearboxes
* Easy to drive
    * This can be driven with one joy stick to control each side
    * This makes it very intuitive for a rookie driver to pick up
* Potential for high speed and pushing force
    * Easy to gear the wheels for whatever pushing and speed is needed. 
* Weight efficient
    * It is relatively light depending on how you do it
    * Less motors are required per wheel

#### Cons:
* Not as agile as other drive trains
    * It can not move sideways

#### Design Suggestions
4 CIMs:
* Because 6 is overkill when 4 can push around just about any opponent 
* 6 weighs more (defeating a primary benefit of tank)
* 6 is taxing on the electronic aspects of your robot
* 2 is equally problematic because you lack the torque to push around other robots (defeating a different primary benefit of tank)
* If the weight and alliance interactions change 2 or 6 CIMs can be considered

6 wheels:
* 4 wheels have too long of a wheel base and creates scrubbing
* scrubbing is where the wheels have a lot of friction with the ground while turning causing it to not turn well
* 8 adds too much weight and reduces the likelihood you’re doing direct drive on the center wheel
* With this you either need to do a drop center or make the end wheels omnis
    * A drop center will have more traction with the ground
    * Omnis on the front and back are easier to predict for autonomous programs
    
4 to 8 inch wheels

frame dimensions:
* typically err on the side of leaving around an inch in every direction between your perimeter and the sizing restrictions 
* Vertically don’t get TOO close
* Have your frame longer then it is wide
* Make sure wheels are a few inches apart from each other ro reduce tipping
