This is where we talk about **acceptable** shooters. If you create a non-acceptable shooter, you should find a door and go through it.

## Catapults
* Simple and consistent in the way that it fires. 
* Generally can only shoot from one spot, so pick a good spot.

## Backspin Flywheels
* Complex but is easier to adjust on the fly.
* Programmers need to be greatly involved in the design process so the drivers can have appropriate controls over the robot.
