Active intakes are very important because they allow you to "touch it, own it, possess it".

# Spherical Objects
* When you pick up spherical objects you generally want a roller bar of some kind filled with wheels. 
* The bar positioning and size depends on the game and the uses of the bar.

# Disks
* These are almost entirely decided based on holes in the disk and the thickness.
* Generally a dustpan type thing can be used but, depending on availability of the piece, a ground pick up is not needed. 

# Cubes/Rectangular Prisms
* You want a vertically positioned wheel on each side for these.
* Depending on the shape there are other ways control the item once it is inside the robot.
